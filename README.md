# Rainfll-prediction-project
This project proposes a novel  rainfall prediction system for  cities of Bihar(state of india) using a machine learning algorithms. The proposed framework uses four widely used supervised machine learning techniques, i.e., decision tree, Na√Øve Bayes, K-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines.
